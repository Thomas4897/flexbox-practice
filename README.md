# Flexbox Pratice

In this project, I praticed with the flexbox functions in css.

## Instructions

* Start off by forking this repository
* Set up GitHub pages just like the last assignment
* Add a new file called `styles.css`
* Go to your HTML and add a line of code to import your new CSS file
* Finally, edit `styles.css` to style the page in the following ways
  * Add a blue border to each `<div>` element
  * Change the font of each header element to any font that you like
  * Set each image to have a border radius of `50px`
  * Add `25px` of padding to each `<div>` element
  * Add `10px` of margin to each `<li>` element
  * Italicize each `<li>` element
  
## Goals

* Add a shadow to each `<div>`
* Add a background-color to each `<div>`
* Add a background-image to the whole page
